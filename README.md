Task 1:
Build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict the species of the flower based on the features provided.

Simple walkthrough (not full):

Load the Iris dataset (look through sklearn docs to find out how)
80/20 train/test split.
Train a KNN classifier using the training set (see sklearn docs)
Make predictions on the test set.
Evaluate the model using accuracy.
Task 2:
Repeat the same process using 2 other classification algorithms of your choice.
